## Part A Questions to ask 

### https://geekflare.com/dev/fix-out-of-memory-error-in-windows/

Running out of memory is a easy problem to fix, but can happen for a lot of different reasons. first i would ask the end user when he/she last restarted their computer. If it was recently and this happens everytime then say to check task manager and see what is taking up so much space. I would ask why they have so many tabs open on google or if they have downloaded any 3 party applications as it could be malware, just the 100 google tabs they have open, startup apps or even not enough ram. Memory loss can cause a lot of problems in some cases your computer wont even run. to make sure it does not happen theres things you can check on routinely like making sure everythings up to date, optimizing your memory usage and limiting your starting apps.

## Part B What to do after you figure out the problem

### https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-computer-low-memory/

These 3 websites give clear instructions on how to free up or create new memory. The third website shows us how to create virtual memory so we can increase the memory while not spending any money. although its 3 different websites all the instructions are pretty similar on how to free up memory, this is not the most complex task just takes a little bit of time on a computer to know what to do right away.

# Part C What Apps are Good to Use

### https://www.ccleaner.com/?srsltid=AfmBOora3lbap-3kpEOxCYSoIKszaXuRGUUWnWd805N4wt0xPEiDjd6I
### https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download

When i have problems with windows i always use CCleaner. it gets rid of any excess files, programs and fixes the windows start up all while being free. CCleaner is great for a free windows cleaner all times where my computer was slow and running out of memory i used this application and it worked. It deletes all duplicate files, all malware, makes sure computer is up to date. Another good one is malware bytes this one i dont have much personal experience with but ive read a lot about it and it has great reviews, it protects any device its downloaded on, can block ads, viruses and makes sure everything is up to date.

## Question 2

Each one of these sites gives clear instructions on how to find a lost file that you previously worked on. each site simplifies what to do and could be very usefull to the person in need. they show us how to navigate file explorer, uses the search function, learning how to troubleshoot search problems and understanding file locations. theres different ways to figure out where the file went you can use file explorer and search up keywords that could relate to the document. Another way would be using the windows search bar and looking at your recent files
