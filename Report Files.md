Running out of memory is a easy problem to fix, but can happen for a lot of different reasons. first i would ask the end user when he/she last restarted their computer. If it was recently and this happens everytime then say to check task manager and see what is taking up so much space. it could be malware, just the 100 google tabs they have open, startup apps or even not enough ram. Memory loss can cause a lot of problems in some cases your computer wont even run. to make sure it does not happen theres things you can check on routinely like making sure everythings up to date, optimizing your memory usage and limiting your starting apps.
